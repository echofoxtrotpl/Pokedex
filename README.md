# Pokedex react app
**Creation date: 2022-04-09**

You can see my app on surge.sh hosting [here](https://echofoxtrot-pokedex.surge.sh/)

This app is a simple Pokémon catalog made with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
* [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

You can **browse** the pokemon catalog, **search** them by name or **filter** by type and **view their's details**. 

There is also **dark mode**! :)
